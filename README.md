# Music-Gallery-3d-Rotation-
An interactive 3D Music Gallery where users can click on album covers to play music. The album covers rotate in a 3D space, and users can pause and play tracks dynamically. The project includes a preloader, mobile audio fixes, and a start audio button to handle browser autoplay restrictions.

✅ Music Playback on Click – Click an album cover to play its associated song
✅ Autoplay Fix for Mobile – Includes a "Start Audio" button to enable sound on mobile browsers
